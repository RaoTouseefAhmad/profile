Senior Mobile App Developer | Android & iOS | 10+ Years Experience

I’m a senior mobile application developer with 10+ years of hands-on experience building, scaling, and maintaining production-grade Android and iOS applications.

My work focuses on performance, clean architecture, long-term maintainability, and solving real product problems — not just shipping features.

I’ve worked on 300+ mobile apps, including social platforms, AI-powered tools, audio/video apps, utilities, and large-scale consumer products.
