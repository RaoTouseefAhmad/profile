I’m a senior mobile application developer with **10+ years of hands-on experience**
building, scaling, and maintaining real-world Android and iOS applications.

My focus is on **clean architecture, performance, scalability, and long-term
maintainability** — not just shipping features.

I’ve worked on **300+ mobile apps**, including consumer apps, social platforms,
AI-powered tools, audio/video apps, and large-scale production systems.
